In this folder, we provide the necessary files to replicate the results of the paper. In the following, we describe the steps to replicate the results.

In the file results_2021_07_12.csv we provide the results of the computational experiments of the exact algorithms.

In the file results_2022_08_25.csv we provide the results of the computational experiments of LP relaxation (Column Generation).

In the file results_2023_07_01.csv we provide the results of the computational experiments where we check what the effect is of the BDDF formulation when given a good starting solution. 

Please follow the steps in the python script summary.py to replicate the results.
