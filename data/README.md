## Data for replication

In this folder you will find the data used for the replication of the paper. The data is organized in the following way:
- instances: contains the instances used for the computational experiments. The instances are named according to the following convention: `wt<number_of_jobs>_<id_of_instance>.dat` where `<number_of_jobs>` is the number of jobs in the instance and `<id_of_instance>` is the id of the instance. The folder instances is further organized in subfolders according to the number of jobs in the instances. In each of these subfolders, you will find the instances for the respective number of jobs + a folder sol that contains the best known solutions for the instances. The best known solutions are named according to the following convention: `wt<number_of_jobs>_<id_of_instance>.json`.
- settings: contains the settings used for the computational experiments.
- scripts: contains the scripts used for the computational experiments.
