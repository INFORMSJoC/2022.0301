## Description
We present a new flow-based formulation for identical
parallel machine scheduling with a regular objective function and without idle time.
The formulation is constructed with the help of a decision diagram that represents all
job sequences that respect specific ordering rules.  These rules rely on a partition of the planning horizon into, generally
non-uniform, periods and do not exclude all optimal solutions,
but they constrain solutions to adhere to a canonical form.
The new formulation has numerous variables and constraints,
and hence we apply a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition in order to compute the
linear programming relaxation in reasonable time; the resulting lower bound is stronger than
the bound from the classical time-indexed formulation. We develop a branch-and-price framework that solves
three instances from the literature for the first time.
We compare the new formulation with the time-indexed and arc-time-indexed
formulation by means of a series of computational experiments.

## Building
In the original repository, the code was built using the
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system. You can find the full description of
the build process in the [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/u0056096/parallel-machine-bdd) of the
authors. 

## Results

### Comparison of BDDF and ATIF
Performance profiles over all the instances solved to optimality by both
algorithms. BDDF is the algorithm devised in this paper, while ATIF is the
algorithm devised in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2018.0854) by
Oliveira, D. and Pessoa, A.

For a more detailed comparison, we also show the performance profiles for each
pair of number of jobs and number of machines. For the sake of brevity, we refer
to the paper for the description of the results.
