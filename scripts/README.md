To run the executable, you need to provide the path to the instance file as an argument. For example, to run the executable on the instance `data/instances/wt040/wt040_001.dat`, you can use the following command to execute the executable:

```bash
./PM --json data/settings/default_settings.json data/instances/wt040/wt040_001.dat 4
```
